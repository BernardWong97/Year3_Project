# Project Plan
 
## BlockChain in Rust

### Introduction

 Project is to learn Rust Programming Language while creating a BlockChain 
 program with many to many peer-to-peer network relationship using Rust.

### Developers
- Mindaugas Sarskus - G00339629@gmit.ie
- Bernard Wong - G00341962@gmit.ie

### Goal

- To learn and understand a new programming language (Rust Programming Language).
- To overcome challenges arising from building a BlockChain using new language.
- To research and learn the concept of BlockChain and it's algorithm.
- To overcome hurdles from working in a team.
- To adapt and improvise using different development tools. (GitLab instead of GitHub)

### Version Control System

- Git.
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) as the Git-repository manager.
- Repository: [Rust BlockChain](https://gitlab.com/My-/year3_project)

### Schedule
#### Week 1 ( 4<sup>th</sup> February 2019 - 8<sup>th</sup> February 2019)
    Learn and understand Rust Programming language.
        - Learn Rust from various different resources online.
        - Understand the basic concept of Rust enough to build a program.
        
    Understanding BlockChain.
        - Understand BlockChain from various different resources online.
        - Do research on BlockChain and its algorithm.
#### Week 2 ( 11<sup>th</sup> February 2019 - 15<sup>th</sup> February 2019)
    Create the blocks for the BlockChain.
        - Create a cargo project for the program.
        - Create a block structure with a digital signature (SHA-256).
#### Week 3 ( 18<sup>th</sup> February 2019 - 22<sup>th</sup> February 2019)
    Implement consensus algorithm into the BlockChain.
        - There is a lot of consensus algorithm. (e.g. Proof of Work)
        - Decide a consensus algorithm and implement into the project.
#### Week 4 ( 25<sup>th</sup> February 2019 - 1<sup>st</sup> March 2019)
     Error Handling
        - Handling all possible errors in the project.
        - Could not mine blocks when hit iteration limit.
        - The block has no parent block.
#### Week 5 ( 4<sup>th</sup> March 2019 - 8<sup>th</sup> March 2019)
    Setting up the whole BlockChain.
        - Setting up the whole actual BlockChain by implementing everything together.
#### Week 6 ( 11<sup>th</sup> March 2019 - 15<sup>th</sup> March 2019)
    Testing the BlockChain by building into a terminal program and output all necessary details:
        - The whole BlockChain.
        - The mining details. (Output mined block hash)
        - Is the chain valid?
#### Week 7 ( 18<sup>th</sup> March 2019 - 22<sup>nd</sup> March 2019)
    Many to many relationship Peer-to-peer connection.
        - Figure out a way to have multi-threaded peer to peer connection to have distributed BlockChain on every client. (probably p2p crate)
        - Create a network for the BlockChain.
#### Week 8 ( 25<sup>th</sup> March 2019 - 29<sup>th</sup> March 2019)
    A User Interface for the BlockChain data access.
        - Docker
        - Xamarin
        - Terminal
