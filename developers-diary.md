Had first meeting.</p>
Preplanned plan:
- Use GitLab as git repo provider
- Build project on BlockChain
- Learn Rust language
- Use Rust to build BlockChain
- Use Docker for BlockChain and DB
- Backup data (block chain) to DB
- Use Mongo for DB

Need to decide:
- What kind of data we want to store on BlockChain.
- Finalize how our git repo should be structured (folder structure)
- Decide on front-end (do we need it? what kind of info it should display?)
