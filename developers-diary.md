Had first meeting.</p>
Preplanned plan:
- Use GitLab as git repo provider
- Build project on BlockChain
- Learn Rust language
- Use Rust to build BlockChain
- Use Docker for BlockChain and DB
- Backup data (block chain) to DB
- Use Mongo for DB

Need to decide:
- What kind of data we want to store on BlockChain.
- Finalize how our git repo should be structured (folder structure)
- Decide on front-end (do we need it? what kind of info it should display?)

We aggregated to prove what we learned Rust we need to create small project in Rust. But we need to decide what kind of project we should do.

###### 05-02-2019
We met our mentor. He is happy with our project. We need to make Project Plan by next week.
