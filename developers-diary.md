Had first meeting.</p>
Preplaned plan:
- Use GitLab as git repo provider
- Build project on BlockChain
- Lern Rust language
- Use Rust to build BlockChain
- Use Docker for BlockChain and DB
- Backup data (block chain) to DB
- Use Mongo for DB

Need to deside:
- What kind of data we want to store on BlockChain.
- Finalize how our git repo should be structured (folder structure)
- Deside on front-end (do we need it? what kind of info it should display?)

We aggread to prove what we lerned Rust we need to create small project in Rust.
