# Introduction

This repository is for our Year 3 group project that helps us experience what it takes to work as a team like in a company assigning a team project.  
Project's goal is to learn [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology using Rust by researching and building Blockchain using Rust.
